# Youtube videos ad placement

## Problem statement
Numerous time-consuming and expensive operations, such as in-depth data research, contacting businesses to place ads, managing them, and applying the analysis to their product or service, are burdensome for the marketing team throughout the advertising process. The procedure still involves a lot of manual work, whether it be for skippable video advertisements or display ads. The marketing team genuinely wants to adopt the least expensive method to place their ads in the appropriate videos. I strive to resolve this issue through the use of data analysis and visualization.
